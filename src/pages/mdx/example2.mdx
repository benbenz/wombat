# Title

In {year}, the snowfall was above average.
It was followed by a warm spring which caused
flood conditions in many of the nearby rivers.

<Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> and <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> are my favorite colors.

I can write **Markdown** alongside my _JSX_!

$$ y_i = \\beta x_i + \\epsilon_i $$

$$ l_i = \\sum_{k=1}^K w_k Z_{ik} $$
